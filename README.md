## Solana Smart Contract
Interacting with this contract allows you to post any string. This is deployed in Solana devnet. The address of the contract is:

```

```

## Solana dApp
In this app, the user can:
1. Connect to your Phantom wallet.
2. Refresh posts to see all of the posts in descending order (most recent on top).
    - A post will display the author, content, and the timestamp.
3. Enter post and submit it.

Note: I need to approve the transactions first. Inform me if you want to interact with the app in order to approve transactions.
